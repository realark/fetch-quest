* plot
You're a delivery boy. Thinking you were done work for the evening you and your roommate dropped a "heroic" dose and settled in for a quiet night at home.

Suddenly, your boss shows up at your door. There's a rush order that needs to be delivered to the castle ASAP! Normally you'd turn down this request, but a call to adventure tells you to accept the job. Plus, you really could use the overtime pay.

Traverse the overworld, combat enemies, collect packages, and make deliveries!
